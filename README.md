Problem 1:

Assignment1 sample outputs and inference.ppt:

• The presentation contains sample of observations made during the hypertuning process along with inference and model comparisons.

• https://github.com/Shravsridhar/MLP--CIFAR10/blob/master/mlp_cifar10.ipynb

• It contains the final recommended model for the multi layer perceptron along with the settings and performance.

mlp compare.xlsv:

• Excel contains the readings obtained while comparing different sets of parameters.

• The readings for each type are recorded and stored in separate sheets within this excel.

compare_lr.ipynb:

• Sample of comparison and plot made from recordings

Image Augmentation Report.pdf:

• Report for Team Assignment

NOTE:

• In addition, I compared MLP with CNN and code is available for both.

• https://github.com/Shravsridhar/CNN_CIFAR10/blob/master/cnn_cifar10%20(1).ipynb --> Final CNN Model Recommended.

• Comparison is available in final slides of PPT.
