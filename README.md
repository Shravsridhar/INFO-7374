Problem 1:

Assignment1 sample outputs and inference.ppt:

• The presentation contains sample of observations made during the hypertuning process along with inference and model comparisons.

• https://github.com/Shravsridhar/MLP--CIFAR10/blob/master/mlp_cifar10.ipynb

• It contains the final recommended model for the multi layer perceptron along with the settings and performance.

compare_lr.ipynb:
• Sample of comparison and plot made from recordings

Image Augmentation Report.pdf:
• Report for Team Assignment

File names 
CNN Model: cnn_cifar

MLP Model: mlp_cifar

DATA AUGMENTATION IMPLEMENTATION: data_aug

NOTE:

• In addition, I compared MLP with CNN and code is available for both.

• Comparison is available in final slides of PPT.
